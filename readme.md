# Firebase Cloud Messaging example for quick integration

This repo is example for Firebase Cloud Messaging. It may help for quick implementation, i implemented fcm scripts after window load for avoid from speed issues. 
You can remove jquery, and jquery events, they are just test events. Enjoy!

Important notes;
Manifest.json and firebase-messaging-sw.js must be in the root folder. 
Notification actions are going to only https urls.
